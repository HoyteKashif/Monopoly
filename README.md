## FIXME
- [ ] Player purchasing already owned property is not handled properly
- [ ] Player wealth is Calculated without the collective price of the buildings owned by this player

## TODO
- [ ] Implement Chance card selection

- [ ] Implement Community Chest card selection

- [ ] Implement Hotel Purchasing

- [ ] Check for any additional rules when the user roles doubles

- [ ] Make it so that if the player throws doubles three times in succession, they go immediately to JAIL

- [ ] Determine the order of the players by randomly rolling the dice then 
putting the players in order from highest to lowest value

- [ ] If a player lands on a property and they do not wish to purchase
it allow their to be an auction. Bank sells the property to the highest bidder. Bidding may start at any price.
